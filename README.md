# Is-The-Word-A-Palindrome-Program

The Is the Word a Palindrome Program is designed to determine whether a given word is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word that reads the same forwards and backwards. This program checks the input word, compares its reverse spelling, and verifies whether the word retains the same sequence of letters in both directions. It provides a simple and efficient way to identify palindromes.
